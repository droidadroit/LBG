# Image compression using LBG
A lenna image is compressed using Linde-Buzo-Gray algorithm for vector quantization. The image is divided into blocks of size *4 x 4* and the corresponding vectors are fed to the LBG algorithm. This generates a codebook of a predetermined size which is used to generate the reconstructed image.
